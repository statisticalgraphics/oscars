# Conclusion

Through this project, we were able to gain the insights to answer our initial questions:
1)	Was there racial bias present when it came to choosing what movies were considered “good”? 
2)	Are movies that have female lead roles as popular as those that have male lead roles?
Additionally, 

We created a custom theme for the graphs, and only used color scheme that is accessible to people with color deficiency.
